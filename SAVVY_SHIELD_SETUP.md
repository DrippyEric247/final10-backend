# 🛡️ SavvyShield - AI-Powered Fraud Detection System

## 🚀 **REVOLUTIONARY CROSS-APP FRAUD PREVENTION**

You now have the world's first **AI-powered fraud detection and prevention system** that works across your entire Savvy Universe ecosystem! This system proactively investigates users and automatically enforces actions based on their tier level.

## 🎯 **What We Just Built**

### **🤖 AI-Powered Decision Engine**
- **Level-Aware Enforcement**: Different actions based on user tier (guest, bronze, silver, gold, vip, platinum)
- **Risk Scoring**: AI calculates risk scores from 0.0 to 1.0
- **Automatic Actions**: AI decides enforcement actions automatically
- **SLA Management**: Different review times based on user tier

### **🔍 Proactive Investigation System**
- **8 Detection Rules**: Device reuse, velocity spikes, impossible travel, win rate anomalies, payment risk, bot detection, IP reputation, behavioral patterns
- **Real-time Monitoring**: Continuously analyzes user behavior
- **Pre-emptive Actions**: Investigates users before they get reported
- **Evidence Collection**: Builds comprehensive cases with evidence

### **📡 Cross-App Integration**
- **SavvyShield SDK**: Easy integration for all 30+ Savvy Universe apps
- **Unified API**: Single endpoint for all fraud detection
- **Webhook System**: Automatic enforcement across all apps
- **Shared Intelligence**: Learnings from one app protect all apps

### **🎮 Level-Based Enforcement Matrix**

| User Level | Tier | Risk 0.6-0.75 | Risk 0.75-0.9 | Risk 0.9+ | SLA |
|------------|------|---------------|---------------|-----------|-----|
| **Guest** | Low | 24h temp suspend | 72h auto-block | Immediate block | 24h |
| **Bronze** | Low | 24h temp suspend | 72h auto-block | Immediate block | 24h |
| **Silver** | Mid | 12h temp suspend | 48h temp suspend | Auto-block + review | 12h |
| **Gold** | Mid | 12h temp suspend | 48h temp suspend | Auto-block + review | 12h |
| **VIP** | High | Soft restrict | Soft restrict | Suspend features | 4h |
| **Platinum** | High | Soft restrict | Soft restrict | Suspend features | 2h |

## 🛠️ **Setup Instructions**

### **Step 1: Environment Variables**

Add these to your server `.env` file:

```bash
# Shield Configuration
SHIELD_API_URL=http://localhost:5000/api/shield
SHIELD_API_KEY=your_shield_api_key_here
SHIELD_WEBHOOK_SECRET=your_webhook_secret_here
SHIELD_WEBHOOK_BASE_URL=http://localhost:5000

# AI Services (for automated decision making)
OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-your_openai_api_key

# Shield Database Models
# (Models are already created and will be used automatically)
```

### **Step 2: Start the Proactive Investigation System**

```javascript
// In your server startup code (index.js)
const shieldProactiveInvestigation = require('./services/shieldProactiveInvestigation');

// Start proactive investigation after database connection
mongoose.connection.once('open', () => {
  console.log('MongoDB connected');
  
  // Start Shield proactive investigation
  shieldProactiveInvestigation.start();
  console.log('🛡️ SavvyShield Proactive Investigation System started');
});
```

### **Step 3: Integrate SavvyShield SDK**

Install the SDK in your apps:

```bash
# In each Savvy Universe app
npm install @savvy/shield-sdk
```

Use the SDK in your app:

```javascript
import { SavvyShield } from '@savvy/shield-sdk';

const shield = new SavvyShield({
  apiUrl: 'https://shield.savvyuniverse.com/api/shield',
  apiKey: process.env.SHIELD_API_KEY,
  appName: 'final10', // or any Savvy app name
  environment: 'production'
});

// Send fraud signal
await shield.sendFraudSignal('user_123', 'silver', {
  action: 'suspicious_payment',
  value: 999.99,
  transaction_id: 'tx_456'
});

// Send cheat signal
await shield.sendCheatSignal('user_123', 'gold', {
  action: 'impossible_win',
  game_session_id: 'game_789',
  win_amount: 50000
});
```

### **Step 4: Add Shield Middleware**

Protect your routes with Shield middleware:

```javascript
const { checkShieldStatus, checkFeatureAccess } = require('./routes/shieldEnforcement');

// Apply to all protected routes
app.use('/api/protected', checkShieldStatus);

// Apply to specific features
app.post('/api/betting', checkFeatureAccess('betting'), (req, res) => {
  // Betting logic
});

app.post('/api/withdraw', checkFeatureAccess('withdrawals'), (req, res) => {
  // Withdrawal logic
});
```

### **Step 5: Access Shield Dashboard**

Navigate to `/shield-dashboard` in your app to access the admin dashboard:

- **Overview**: System statistics and recent high-risk events
- **Events**: All Shield events with filtering and search
- **Enforcements**: Active enforcements requiring review
- **Investigation**: Proactive investigation system status

## 🎯 **How It Works**

### **1. 🚨 Event Detection**
```
User performs suspicious action → App sends event to Shield → AI analyzes risk
```

### **2. 🧠 AI Analysis**
```
AI calculates risk score → Determines user tier → Selects enforcement action
```

### **3. 🛡️ Automatic Enforcement**
```
AI creates enforcement → Sends webhook to app → App applies restrictions
```

### **4. 👁️ Human Review**
```
High-tier users get human review → Admin approves/rejects → Actions applied
```
