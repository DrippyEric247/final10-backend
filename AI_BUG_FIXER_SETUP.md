## 🔧 **Customization Options**

### **AI Model Configuration**
You can customize the AI behavior by modifying `scripts/ai_bug_fixer.js`:

```javascript
// Use different AI models
const model = 'gpt-4'; // or 'claude-3', 'gemini-pro'

// Adjust AI behavior
const temperature = 0.1; // Lower = more focused fixes
const maxTokens = 4000; // Response length limit
```

### **Auto-Merge Rules**
Customize merge behavior in `.github/workflows/auto-merge-ai-fixes.yml`:

```yaml
# Only auto-merge critical fixes
if: severity == 'critical' && tests_passed

# Require manual approval for complex changes
if: files_changed > 5 || lines_changed > 100
```

### **Bug Report Categories**
Add custom categories in `BugReportModal.js`:

```javascript
const categories = [
  'UI/UX Issue',
  'Performance Problem',
  'Payment Error',
  'API Issue',
  'Security Concern'
];
```
