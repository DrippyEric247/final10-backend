# eBay API Scope Upgrade Guide

## Current Status ✅
Your eBay integration is **working with real data** using the basic scope `https://api.ebay.com/oauth/api_scope`. However, this scope has limited functionality.

## Current Limitations
The basic scope provides:
- ✅ Basic item search
- ✅ Item details
- ❌ Limited filtering options
- ❌ No advanced search parameters
- ❌ Limited auction-specific data

## Upgrade to Full buy.browse Scope

To get the full functionality, you need to enable the `buy.browse` scope:

### Step 1: Go to eBay Developer Portal
1. Visit: https://developer.ebay.com/
2. Sign in with your eBay account
3. Go to "My Account" > "Applications"

### Step 2: Edit Your Application
1. Find your application and click "Edit"
2. Go to the "OAuth Scopes" section
3. Look for: `https://api.ebay.com/oauth/api_scope/buy.browse`

### Step 3: Enable the Scope
1. Check the box for `buy.browse` scope
2. If it's grayed out or requires approval:
   - Fill out the required information about your app
   - Explain that you're building an auction aggregation platform
   - Submit for review (can take 1-3 business days)

### Step 4: Test the Upgrade
After enabling the scope, restart your server and test:

```bash
cd server
node test-real-ebay.js
```

You should see it successfully use the `buy.browse` scope instead of the basic scope.

## Benefits of buy.browse Scope

With the full scope, you'll get:
- ✅ Advanced search filtering
- ✅ Better auction data
- ✅ More detailed item information
- ✅ Enhanced trending capabilities
- ✅ Category-specific searches
- ✅ Price range filtering
- ✅ Time-based filtering

## Current Working Features

Even with the basic scope, your app now has:
- ✅ **Real eBay data** (not mock data)
- ✅ **Live auction items**
- ✅ **Real pricing and bidding**
- ✅ **Actual item details**
- ✅ **Working search functionality**

## Testing Your Integration

Your eBay integration is already working! Test it by:

1. **Start your server**: `npm start` in the server directory
2. **Start your React app**: `npm start` in the client directory
3. **Visit**: http://localhost:3000/auctions

## Next Steps

1. **Immediate**: Your app works perfectly with real eBay data
2. **Optional**: Upgrade to `buy.browse` scope for enhanced features
3. **Future**: Consider additional eBay scopes for more advanced features

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter issues:

1. **Check credentials**: Make sure EBAY_CLIENT_ID and EBAY_CLIENT_SECRET are in your .env file
2. **Restart server**: After making changes, restart your server
3. **Check console**: Look for authentication messages in your server logs
4. **Test endpoint**: Visit http://localhost:5000/api/ebay/search?q=iPhone
